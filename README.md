# QB64-CBE

What is QB64-CBE? QB64-CBE is a QB64-GL based programming language developed by The Joyful Programmer. It boasts many internal optimizations, modernizations, and language enhancements compared to QB64-GL so it can help bring BASIC developers who enjoy procedural programming into the modern age without all the complexities of many other programming paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

QB64-CBE is designed around the modern 64-Bit processor, unlike its predecessor, QB64-GL, and will not support 32-Bit systems. The main reason, in my opinion, the industry has hung onto the 32-Bit processor is due to the lack of native 64-Bit applications. However, that is changing rapidly and soon all software will be 64-Bit. Personally, I do not know of any retail store who are selling brand new 32-Bit machines. If there are, then there isn't very many of them. The last Intel 32-bit chip, Pentium 4E, came out in February 2004 and was discontinued in 2005.
